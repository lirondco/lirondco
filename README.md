#### About Me 👧

Hi. I'm Liron and I am a full stack web developer based in Southern California and remotely, in Israel. I currently work with React.JS, jQuery, HTML5, CSS, PostgreSQL, and Express. If what you need is not what I listed, still try asking me anyway. I also like maps and graphs.

I also enjoy video games, the outdoors, cooking, and sometimes I try photography too!

Check out my [website](https://www.lirondc.com) if you wanna learn more and see colors!
