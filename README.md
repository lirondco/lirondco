### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### About Me ðŸ‘§

Hi. I'm Liron and I am a full stack web developer based in Southern California and remotely, in Israel. I currently work with React.JS, jQuery, HTML5, CSS, PostgreSQL, and Express. If what you need is not what I listed, still try asking me anyway. I also like maps and graphs.

I also enjoy video games, the outdoors, cooking, and sometimes I try photography too!

Check out my [website](https://www.lirondc.com) if you wanna learn more and see colors! 


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, French, and Cantonese.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how to say stuff in Hebrew. Webdev-related questions are ok too.
